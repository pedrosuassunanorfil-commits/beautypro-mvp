The AI engineer initiated development of a SaaS application for aesthetics professionals, focusing on core MVP features: subscription, service/product management, financial tracking, and an external booking system. The approach involved a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB setup, with Shadcn UI for the frontend. A significant portion of the trajectory involved iterative development and debugging, addressing backend API errors (Pydantic, optional fields), and frontend UI issues (authentication flow, theme management, clipboard API, multi-select in finance, booking hours). The most challenging phase was deploying the application to production environments (Railway for backend, Vercel for frontend), which was fraught with build failures, dependency conflicts, and configuration complexities, requiring multiple attempts and detailed user guidance. The current state reflects a functional core application, with ongoing efforts to stabilize frontend deployment.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a monthly recurring SaaS web application for aesthetics professionals. This system should enable professionals to register and price services/products (with stock management for products), record financial inputs/outputs, and access a general balance with time, service, or product type filters (with PDF reports). The platform must feature a dashboard with various functionalities and an external appointment system. This booking system provides a unique link for clients to schedule appointments by providing name, phone number, desired service, date, and half-hour slots. Professionals can then accept, decline, or reschedule appointments, sending proposals via WhatsApp. The authentication system requires individual accounts and a simple registration process. The application must feature modern UI/UX with customizable themes (default and pink are desired, gray was removed), micro-animations, and adequate spacing.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **UI/UX:** Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS for styling and modern design.
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Railway (backend), MongoDB Atlas (DBaaS), GitHub (version control).
- **Payment Gateway (Planned):** Mercado Pago.
- **Backend:** Pydantic for data validation, JWT for authentication, UUIDs for IDs, CORS.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently focused on resolving the frontend deployment issue on Vercel. After successfully deploying the backend to Railway, the Vercel build process for the React frontend () is failing due to dependency conflicts, specifically with  requiring an older  version (16-18) while the project uses  version 19. The last proposed action (Chat 223) was to simplify the  by removing non-essential dependencies to alleviate these conflicts. The user needs to apply these changes to their GitHub repository and then trigger a redeploy on Vercel. The success of this action is pending user confirmation.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Verify the Vercel frontend deployment status after the  simplification and redeployment.
